# Todo List - Review
- A todo-list app where you can add and remove tasks to be done.
- The design was provided by Frontend Mentor. I only programmed it.
- I built the app using Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Functionalities
- You can add and remove tasks.
- The webpage will load added tasks from local storage whenever you open it.
- You can check tasks as completed.
- You can filter through completed and not completed tasks.
- Drag and drop, theme-toggle and other features are not working yet.
